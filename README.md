# Profiling-Caching-Memory_Access
This project explores the impact of caching, memory access patterns, and data structure selection on execution performance. Through structured experiments in Java, we analyze how volatile memory, cache locality, and data structures (LinkedList vs. TreeSet) affect execution speed.
