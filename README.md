# Profiling Caching, Memory Access, and Data Structures ⚡ 

This project explores the impact of caching, memory access patterns, and data structure selection on execution performance. Through structured experiments in Java, we analyze how volatile memory, cache locality, and data structures (LinkedList vs. TreeSet) affect execution speed.

🔍 Key Insights

Volatile vs. Non-Volatile Memory: How forcing access to main memory affects performance.

Cache Locality & Access Patterns: The impact of accessing sequential vs. random array elements.

Data Structures & Search Performance: Comparing LinkedList and TreeSet for .contains() operations.

🛠 Technologies Used

Language: Java

Concepts: Memory Hierarchy, Caching, Data Structures, Performance Profiling

📊 Experiments Conducted

Volatile vs. Non-Volatile Loop Variable Access

Evaluates execution time differences between CPU register caching and forced main memory access.

Array Element Access Patterns

Analyzes how spatial locality and cache misses affect access speed.

LinkedList vs. TreeSet Search Performance

Compares O(n) traversal vs. O(log n) search efficiency.

🚀 How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Performance-Analysis.git

Compile and run the experiments:

javac Memory.java

java Memory <size> <experiments> <seed>

📌 Future Enhancements

Benchmarking with larger datasets and different CPU architectures.

Extending to additional data structures like HashSet and ArrayList.

Optimizing for multithreading and parallel execution.
